# SCT_ML_Task3
implement a support vector machine to classify images of cats and dogs from the kaggle dataset
### 🐾 Dataset
Due to GitHub size limits, the Cats vs Dogs dataset is hosted externally.  
👉 [Download Dataset from Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RLvyErIYEWjfWpnY0xob02HGqgol2Qtx?usp=sharing)

After downloading, extract it inside the `dataset/` folder before running the project.
